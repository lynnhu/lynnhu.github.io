I was the lead designer for important features such as the Advanced Cycle Chart, Glow Premium and also helped growing Glow’s designer team.</p><h2>About Glow</h2><p>Glow is the oldest app with largest user base. Strategically it is also the most important app to the company because it is the top funnel that brings users to our pregnancy tracker Glow Nurture and baby tracker Glow Baby. It also has a lot of monetization potential.</p><p>As of April 2017, It has 18k reviews at 5 stars in App Store & over 47k reviews at 4.6 stars and more than 1 million downloads in Google Play Store.</p><h2>Advanced Cycle Chart</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Basal body temperature (BBT) is the lowest body temperature attained during rest (usually during sleep). Ovulation causes an increase of one-half to one degree Fahrenheit in BBT for women, so many women monitor of BBT along with other signs such as cervical mucus to estimate the day of ovulation. </p><p>Glow had a simple and clean BBT chart  from very early on, but with significant room for improvement:</p><ul><li>It was difficult to see each month’s trend because it doesn’t show the entire cycle in one screen.</li><li>It was difficult to see other factors that might influence body temperature or ovulation date, such as sleep, alcohol intake, cervical mucus and ovulation test.</li></ul><p>Since the launch of original BBT chart, we keep getting user feedbacks about how the chart can be improved. At the same time, users often share charts from our competitor apps such as Fertility Friend and Kindara in our community group <a href="https://glowing.com/community/group/51" target="_blank">Chart Analysis</a>. If users would go through the trouble using one app just for the charting and our app for everything else, that means we have a strong app but missing a good BBT chart feature.</p><p>What’s more, powerful BBT charts are usually not offered for free. As we were trying to monetize Glow, revamping the BBT chart and start charging for advanced features would both satisfy our users’ demand and our pocket. </p><h3>Challenge</h3><p>While “less is more” has become a design intuition, we had to break it because it’s just the opposite for BBT chart design. Only users who are very serious about getting pregnant can commit to tracking and analyzing their basal body temperature every day. Not only does it require persistence and time commitment, but also much more technical knowledge about your body and fertility.</p><p>The number of things that may influence a woman’s ovulation day is huge, because our bodies are intricate systems that cannot be reduced to single cause-effect relationships. The basics data points for the BBT chart include body temperature, period days, fertile window, cycle day number (CD), Day Past Ovulation(DPO) and <a href="https://glowing.com/article/12004/determining-the-coverline" target="_blank">coverline</a>. Things that can potentially influence one’s body temperature or ovulation day include sex, cervical mucus, ovulation/pregnancy test, cervical position, sleep duration, smoke, alcohol intake, stress level, physical symptoms (21 options in app) and moods (19 options in app). That is 49 items in total. The challenge was to find a readable, scaleable and interactive way to display these data in one chart that may be logged by users all together.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>By default, Advanced Cycle Chart shows the monthly overview, but users can zoom in to better see the details.</p><figure class="fullwidth"><img class="screengif" src="img/glow-bbt-zoom.gif" alt="Zooming in on Advanced Cycle Chart using gestures"></figure><p>Because of limited space we show all logs as icons. Some are more straightforward such as using colors to show severity, while others can be abstract such as using different icons for each cervical mucus texture. Therefore for the more abstract ones we allow users to tap on the icon to see a little popover explanation.</p><figure class="fullwidth"><img class="screengif" src="img/glow-bbt-tap.gif" alt="Tapping on Advanced Cycle Chart to reveal more information"></figure><h3>Result</h3><p>Advanced Cycle Chart was a huge success for both user engagement and monetization effort:</p><ul><li>There is a 13% increase in the number of users who log BBT.</li><li>32% of Glow Premium subscriptions were made from CTAs within Advanced Cycle Chart feature as it’s included in Glow Premium subscription service</li><li>We also added a easy share-to-community feature. Most charts shared in *Chart Analysis* group are from Glow now.</li></ul><h2>Infographics</h2><p>I also helped make infographics for the marketing purpose occasionally, which I enjoyed doing a lot.</p><figure class="fullwidth"><img src="img/glow-data-diarrhea.png" alt=""><figcaption>How diarrhea corelated to cycle.</figcaption></figure><figure class="fullwidth"><img src="img/glow-data-moon.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Cycles correlate to moon phases.</figcaption></figure><figure class="fullwidth"><img src="img/glow-data-cycle-length.png" alt=""><figcaption>Most people estimate their cycle length wrong.</figcaption></figure><figure class="fullwidth"><img src="img/glow-data-sex.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Glow + Wired infographics on sex data.</figcaption></figure></div></div></article></section><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="js/main.min.js"></script><footer><div class="container"><hr><p>© 2017 Lynn Hu</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/lynn_hu/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li><li class="second"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanglynnhu/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="mailto:lynn.yang.hu@gmail.com" target="_blank">Email</a></li></ul></div></footer></body></html>
