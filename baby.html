Being parents is a difficult job that people often have to figure out while doing it for the first time. “Is this normal or should I take my baby to doctor” is the most frequently asked question. And babies under 12 months old often demand a lot of attention and care at random times of the day. Despite all these, parents want to do everything to ensure their babies are happy and healthy.</p><p>Two years since the company’s founding, we already have Glow that helps couples get pregnant and Nurture to track their pregnancy. Making a baby app feels like a natural next step both for expanding our market and fulfilling our users’ needs, so we set out to design an app that tracks baby’s activities and health. We also want to make new parents’ life easier, because as busy and sleep-deprived as they are, a tracking app that only adds more work is not worth using.</p><h2>Outcome</h2><ul><li>We designed and built the initial app in 7 months. Glow Baby was incepted in July 2015 and launched in February 2016.</li><li>Apple App Store: 4.5 star on App Store with 1.3k reviews & 4.6 on Play Store with over 3k reviews as of March. Over 100,000 downloads on Play Store.</li><li>We launched monetization features such as comparative insights and additional partner connect. Out of all 4 Glow apps, Glow Baby reached monetization goal soon after launching.</li></ul><figure class="fullwidth"><img src="img/baby-feature-store.jpg" alt="Glow Baby being featured in Apple App Store on launch day"><figcaption>Glow Baby was featured in Apple App Store on the launch day.</figcaption></figure><h2>My Role</h2><p>I’m the lead designer and partial product manager for Glow Baby. I feel fortunate to be able to design something from ground up but at the same time working with a very experienced and supportive team. My responsibilities include:</p><ul><li>Product management: interviewing users, drafting user testing plans, planning feature, drafting product specs & hosting kick-off meetings with entire team</li><li>Design: designing everything that needs to be designed, including wireframe, UX flow, UI mock & UI animations</li><li>QA: checking every beta build for bugs and UI fixes</li><li>Coding: Updating Glow’s website and creating Email blasts</li></ul><figure class="fullwidth"><img src="img/baby-responsibilities.jpg" alt="Wireframes, specs &amp; user interview guide I created"><figcaption>Wireframes, specs & user interview guide I created</figcaption></figure><h2>Challenge</h2><p>The biggest challenge for me personally is that in the very beginning I had no idea what it is like to have a baby, so I cannot rely on my experience to make design or product decisions. There’s no easy solution except to immerse myself in the world of parents and talk to parents as much as I can whenever I try to verify ideas or designs.</p><blockquote class="emphasis">The biggest challenge for me personally is that in the very beginning I had no idea what it is like to have a baby.</blockquote><p>Within the company, we gathered all the mothers as our think tank and hosted initial brainstorms with them before trying to come up with anything. The mothers shared their experience and pain points during baby’s first year which really helped us set the value proposition of the app. This group also became a Slack channel in which we discuss and verify all the design ideas before implementing them.</p><p>Even with a team of mothers, we know their experience cannot represent all the new parents out there. Since the launch of Nurture, we have gained enough users for an active in-app community where people talk about all aspects of parenting. We took advantage of our community polling feature to post questions and quickly gather opinions from real users. We also used usertesting.com to help find new parents to test competitor’s apps and our own app after it’s launched.</p><figure class="fullwidth"><a href="https://glowing.com/community/topic/72057594039108315/do-you-time-your-pumping-sessions" target="_blank"><img src="img/baby-pumping-poll.jpg" alt="We used Glow Community polls to collect user opinion"></a><figcaption>We used Glow Community polls to collect user opinion</figcaption></figure><p>I interviewed mothers within and outside our user base. I reached out to friends and asked about their experience and the apps they used. I even asked a friend to export the data she logged with another app so that I can create designs using real data. I downloaded and used 20+ baby apps, signed up for emails from BabyCenter and the Bump, watched breastfeeding and breast bump videos, and looked up baby poop on Google Images.</p><p>The second challenge for me is to overcome the hesitation and fear to be wrong when making design decisions. All the baby apps on the market have different designs but few reach our standard for “well-designed”. Baby’s activities and other supplemental functionalities are so diverse in their nature that there isn’t a simple, well-established design pattern to follow like social or shopping apps. On one hand this gives me enormous freedom to think and create from scratch, but on the other it largely increases the number of design decisions to be made and the difficulty making them. With as much research as possible, I can still feel like an imposter trying to make decisions for real parents. As a product owner I learned to just make the decision with the best resources I have and move on. But I also need to accept that later that decision might be proved wrong and we will always be iterating on the app.</p><blockquote class="emphasis">Baby’s activities to be tracked and other supplemental functionalities are so diverse in their nature that there isn’t a simple, well-established design pattern to follow like social or shopping apps.</blockquote><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-5"><h2>The Evolution of Home Page</h2><p>Eat, sleep and pee/poop are three most essential and frequent activities for babies under one year old, and parents are most concerned whether these activities are going normal. It took me many rounds of iteration to figure out the right layout for logging and presenting information.</p></div><div class="col-sm-7"><figure><img class="screengif" src="img/baby-home-designprocess.gif" alt="Design process for the home page"><figcaption>Design process for the home page.</figcaption></figure></div></div><h2>The Beloved Pattern Chart</h2><p>Pattern Chart is one of our users’ favorite features and frequently mentioned in app reviews:</p><blockquote class="quote">“I love that I can see all the days together and notice any patterns so I can create a better schedule for her as I start to sleep train. ” <br/>– Calisurf27</blockquote><blockquote class="quote">“(I) start to see patterns for your baby form. Like my daughter poops between 3pm-9pm so I brace myself for diaper changes during that period of time.” <br/>– KatieKat419</blockquote><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6"><p>But it wasn’t planned to be in the first version in the beginning. The Minimum Viable Product was going to be a scrollable list.</p><p>The list is easier to built, and satisfies the basic need to view history and edit records. But does it really add that much value to parents? It doesn’t do justice to parents’ extra work to log those data, which was our initial goal.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6"><figure class="scrollable-summary"><img src="img/baby-summary-list.jpg" alt="A scrollable long list showing what happened on each day."></figure></div></div><p>Even though the design for history view has already started, we decided to rethink the entire thing and eventually landed on a calendar like user experience – not only can users view history, patterns and daily summaries, they can also alter records from within the chart. Detecting the pattern requires higher density of information in one screen, but editing requires objects to be big enough for tapping. We resolved this conflict by adding a zooming interaction.</p><figure class="fullwidth"><img class="screengif" src="img/baby-pattern-interaction.gif" alt="Scrolling across days.
